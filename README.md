Author Conference Citation Topic Model with Network Regularization

The code is based on GibbsLDA++ (http://gibbslda.sourceforge.net/), and similar to ACCT. But I extended the ACCT model so that the topic distributions of paper, authors, conferences, citations are smoothed and regularized by network structure (network is created by citation and co-author network)

Most of the places that I modified should be labeled by "add by liu liu". But it's been a while since I did this project.
